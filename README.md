# Inventory Application

This project was built as part of [The Odin Project: NodeJS course]("https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/nodejs-inventory-application") in order to practice the following skills:
- Use the _Express Application Generator_ tool to create a skeleton website and application
- Use a database (MongoDB) to store my application's data
- Implement the **M**odel-**V**iew-**C**ontroller (MVC) software design pattern
  - Build models to define what data structures my app should contain
  - Set up routes for requesting different information and templates (i.e. views) to render the data as HTML to be displayed in the browser
  - Build controllers for updating the model and/or view in response to input from users of my app
- Perform **C**reate-**R**ead-**U**pdate-**D**elete (CRUD) operations in my app
- Work with forms in Express using my chosen templating language (EJS)
- Deploy my application to production

## Understanding the Problem

Build a mock inventory app for an imaginary business.

My app needs to have pages (routes) to allow users to perform CRUD operations on my categories and items.

## Plan

Review my [notes]("./notes.md") to see my planning process.
